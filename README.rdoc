= mem_info

This is a lightweight library that wraps access to the data in /proc/meminfo found in many linux variants, which contains live memory usage information about a machine.

== Getting Started

Install the gem:

 gem install mem_info

Require the library like you would expect:

 require 'mem_info'

Then create a new MemInfo object:

 m = MemInfo.new
 m.memtotal     => 70000
 m.memfree      => 54300
 m.memused      => 15700
 m.free_buffers => 75000 

Take a look in lib/mem_info.rb for all fields that are available.
